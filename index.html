              <h5>October 4, 2020 by Kino-Paul Hurylington</h5>
              <img src="IMG1.jpg" alt="entrepreneurship" style="float:left;width:170px;height:100px;">
              <p> The reason why people want to become Entrepreneurs is because the reality of working an average job doesn’t seem rewarding to aspiring entrepreneurs along with having to finish unfulfilling tasks seems really boring to some.</p>
              <p> Some people become entrepreneurs because they see it as a mandatory journey to take. Their prior experience in the job market or achievements in education makes them realize that working for others is no longer a life suited for them. </p>
